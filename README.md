# Clock, Stopwatch, and Compound Interest Calculator

This project combines a clock, a stopwatch, and a compound interest calculator into a single web page for convenient access. You can easily keep track of time, measure elapsed time, and calculate compound interest with just one click.

## Features

1. **Clock**: A simple clock displaying the current time in real-time.

2. **Stopwatch**: Measure elapsed time with the stopwatch feature. Start, stop, and reset whenever you need.

3. **Compound Interest Calculator**: Easily calculate compound interest by entering principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.

## Usage

### Clock

- The clock automatically displays the current time.
- No additional action required.

### Stopwatch

- Click on the "Start" button to start the stopwatch.
- Click on the "Stop" button to pause the stopwatch.
- Click on the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to zero.

### Compound Interest Calculator

2. Enter the interest rate (annual percentage).
3. Enter the time period (in years).
4. Choose the compounding frequency (annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly).
5. Click on the "Calculate" button to see the compound interest.
