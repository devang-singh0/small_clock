# Clock, Stopwatch, and Compound Interest Calculator

This project combines a clock, a stopwatch, and a compound interest calculator into a single web page for convenient access. You can easily keep track of time, measure elapsed time, and calculate compound interest with just one click.

## Features

1. **Clock**: A simple clock displaying the current time in real-time.

2. **Stopwatch**: Measure elapsed time with the stopwatch feature. Start, stop, and reset whenever you need.

3. **Compound Interest Calculator**: Easily calculate compound interest by entering principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.

## Usage
